**Feature request rules**
This is just a template to help you post a useful issue. Erase these rules and any irrelevant categories and content as
you see fit.

- Only submit issues related to the latest version of the mod for the currently supported version of Minecraft (which is
  currently 1.12.2 and 1.16.5).
- When referring to software versions always use the actual version number and never "latest".
- Do not request support for other mods (that should be
  done [here](https://github.com/ferreusveritas/DynamicTrees/issues/443)) or ports to other versions.
- Make sure feature requests come under the project scope. The details of this can be found on
  the [CurseForge page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamictrees).

If you are opening this **for any other reason** than to request a new feature, it will be closed without explanation!
